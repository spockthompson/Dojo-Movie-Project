# Movie Project for Coding Class
- Solutions by: Scotty Thomason

## Business Problem:
- For this project, we have been hired to produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, we will use this database to analyze what makes a movie successful, and will provide recommendations to a stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.
 
### Over the course of this project, we will:

Part 1: Download several files from IMDBâ€™s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.
Part 2: Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.
Part 3: Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.
Part 4: Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.
Part 5 (Optional): Produce a Linear Regression model to predict movie performance.
